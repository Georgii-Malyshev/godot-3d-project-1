Assume these translations of in-editor distance (scale) units to game world distance (scale) units: 
 Godot: 1 unit = 1 m
 Trenchbroom: 1 X/Y/Z coordinate unit (not the grid!) = 1/128 meter (128x128x128 cube in Trenchbroom map is a 1x1x1 m cube in Godot's project)

Notes: 
 - when importing Trenchbroom maps, set inverse scale factor in Godot to 128
