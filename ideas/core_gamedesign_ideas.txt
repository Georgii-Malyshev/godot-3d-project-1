- The game is a horroresque artsy "dungeon crawler" with a "mage/necromancer" protagonist: 
  - Think Shadow Tower/King's Field, Ultima Underworld etc. but with RPG mechanics simplified and heavy emphasis on exploration
  
  - Action gameplay should be somewhat reminiscent of Shadow Tower 1 X TES4 Oblivion X Quake 1 X any real-time 
    game where you can play a debuffing-summoning-DD mage
    
  - Gameplaywise main focus is dangerous exploration and tense fights with small groups of enemies
  
- Saving available only at certain points, Kings Field 4-style; 
  - maybe try implementing manual saving at those point into several rewritable slots
  - maybe try implementing an unavoidable (apart from loading from an eralier manual save) regular autosave Dark Souls style

- As you move deeper, you actually discover things that you heard about as myths/abstract concepts earlier in the game

- Spendable resources' (health, mana etc) management is important - you can'r reliably know when you'll get a next refreshment/savepoint

+ ZERO economics: NO buying&selling anything, NO "items durability", NO buying resource replenishing items etc.

- If you run around, enemies hear you long before you see or hear them and they will be more prepared to battle 
  (face your direction, cast magic etc); that forces the player to move around slowly and try to hear enemies before they hear you; 
  sneak makes you walk really quiet but still be audible from a short distance

- Dolmens scattered through remote branches of the game's world, each granting (and replacing) a single unique trait that changes 
  the gameplay a bit (skyrim's mods/Fallout perks style - partial atronach, mana shield, corpse feed etc)

- The "big" gameplay loop is finding unique cursed items (one at a time) and returning them (also one at a time) to the "hub"; 
  the world becomes "cursed" while you carry the item (Mortal Shell+Sanguine Sanctum style)

- Draw the gameworld's map as a graph descending from a single entrypoint; roots branch out that need to be explored, 
  some are unexpectedly connected with others and/or bring you back to surface

- Can warp but 
  1) only after the first boss, 
  2) only from savepoints, 
  3) Not when you carry a cursed item

- Same spells are not only used in battle but also unlock progress (destroy barricades, open sigils etc); 
  - Items also unlock some routes and areas

+ No level-ups-by-XP-gained

- You gradually grow more powerful combat-wise by finding new spells and items as you explore the game world

- Enemies encountered early on are more easily defeated as you get more spells and items, 
  but as there are no level-ups, they still remain dangerous

- Absolutely ZERO fucking text/voice comments from "protagonist"
