This directory holds textures that Trenchbroom uses for maps. 

These textures can be overriden in Godot by creating custom materials
(in Godot) and saving them in this directory as resource files with the 
same name as the original textures but with .tres extension.

i.e., to override texture stone.png that the map imported from 
Trenchbroom (with Qodot) uses, create a new spatial material in Godot 
and save it here as stone.tres, then "full build" the map in Godot.
