Various ideas and themes:
  Disturbing nightmare-like scenes that appear randomly after death (but not on the first death!), Yume Nikki-style:
    - Morgue;
    - Sitting at a table with a dead girl, Masodov-style;
    - Endless grey-and-black stairs and floors, Sokurov's 'The Stone' style;
  Most dreadful spells are also used at some locations/storypoints to move further (E.Y.E. Divine Cybermancy-style);

Skills: 
  Decaying Touch: 
    Get withing close-melee distance and touch a single enemy to set decay, making him take continuous medium damage over medium period of time;
  Silencing stare: 
    Stare at the enemy for a few seconds without him leaving the screen to silence him for a long time, not letting him use any magic;
  Corpse totem: 
    Target a corpse or a pile of bones at a distance to reforge it into a bonestructure that shoot homing bone barrages at enemies;
  Corrupting Bonespikes:
    Target an area on any flat, big enough surface and summon several violently protruding spikes that damage any enemies they hit and apply decay;
  Reap:
    Target a nearby corpse for a few seconds to consume it, regenerating some HP instantly and applying a short-lived HP regen to self;
  Hexblast:
    Target an enemy marked by your curses (any debuff/DoT that hasn't worn off yet) to detonate him, instantly expiring all debuffs and dealing damage and AOE damage (the longer debuff ticks the more damage Hexblast deals);
  Frail:
    Stare at the target for a few moments to curse it with a long-timed debuff that slows it down, lowers it's resistances&damage output and kills it if has less than 20% of health while the debuff is active;
  Spectral Scythe:
    A slow-buildup powerful attack in a long melee range and a wde area with a spectral scythe that reaches through walls and applies short-lived Slow debuff;
  Dark Stab:
    A fast-buildup summoning of a fast spectral dagger that stabs a single target within a medium-melee range, dealing damage and short-lived Dark DoT;
  Whimpers:
    Summon several whimpering, slow-moving spirits that will home in and fly at the single target, dealing damage and medium-lived Dark DoT;
  Bone Barrage: 
    Shoots a violent barrage of fast piercing splintered bones and teeth
    
Enemies:
  Most enemies are levitating to use as little animation as humanly possibe;
  Pretty easily killed jump-scare screamers (with knives or something) that can get in close VERY FAST which makes them scary and dangerous;
  Levitating skull-somethings that try to keep their distance and build up a curse on you (bloodborne 'Winter Lantern'-style) when you're in their line of sight;
  Flying skulls (medium speed, have to get in close to attack), easy to kill;
  Ghosts - flying spectral beings that make horrifying sounds, go right through walls and can build up Curse with melee attacks;
  Flying something - keeps medium distance, shoots projectiles;
  Specters - flying dark specters with goat skulls, shoot homing projectiles;
  Zombies - close in on you with medium speed and corrupting spikes protrude from their bodies when they are in the medium-melee range;

Locations: 
  Cursed Woods
  Abandoned Village (S.T.A.L.K.E.R. ShoC's 'Bloodsucker Village'-style)
  Haunted Dungeons
