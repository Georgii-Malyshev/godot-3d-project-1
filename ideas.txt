("+" - implemented)

Gameplay mechanics: 
  + Mana slowly regenerates, but only up to a certain low threshold and only if it was not spent in the last few seconds;
  + Health slowly regenerates, but only up to a very low threshold (about 15% of max?) and only if no damage was taken in the last few seconds;
  - Saving only at certain points, Kings Field 4-style;
  - Player gradually grows more powerful combat-wise by finding new spells as you explore the game world;
  - Some spells/items found by exploring/beating certain bosses allow to unlock previously blocked areas;
  - No level-ups-by-XP-gained, max health and max mana are increased only by finding certain items, spell damage stays the same;
  - Enemies encountered early on are more easily defeated as the player gets more spells and items, but as there are no level-ups, they still remain really dangerous;

  - The farther away from savepoints, the more risky exploring gets, but returning back to a savepoint prematurely means leaving new interesting placec that you just got to, Yume Nikki-style;
  
  - Some areas are dangerous to stand immobile in (enemies can find your or something, in the swamp you start to slowly sink and attract mosquitoes, in the darkness things start nibbing at your health etc.);

Various ideas and themes:
  - Absolutely ZERO fucking text/voice comments from "protagonist"
  - Disturbing nightmare-like scenes that appear randomly after death (but not on the first death!), Yume Nikki-style:
    - Morgue;
    - Sitting at a table with a dead girl, Masodov-style;
    - Endless grey-and-black stairs and floors, Sokurov's 'The Stone' style;
  - Most dreadful spells are also used at some locations/storypoints to move further (E.Y.E. Divine Cybermancy-style);

Spells (to be renamed): 

  Summon weapon:
    - Poisoned Dagger:
        Quickly summon a fast dagger that can stab a single target within a short melee range several times before dissapearing, applying poison;
    - Dark Whip
        Summon a dark long-reaching spectral whip that can be swung several times before dissapearing;
    - Spectral Scythe:
        Summon a slow but powerful spectral scythe that has medium reach, hits wide area, goes through walls and slows enemies it hits;

  Deal direct damage at distance:
    - Whimpers:
        Summon several whimpering, slow-moving spirits that will pursue a single target, dealing damage;
    + Bone Barrage: 
        Shoots a violent barrage of fast piercing splintered bones

  Use corpses:
    - Corpse Totem: 
        Target a corpse or a pile of bones at a distance to reforge it into a bonestructure that shoot homing bone barrages at enemies;
    - Reap:
        Target a nearby corpse for a few seconds to consume it, regenerating some HP instantly and applying a short-lived HP regen to self;
    - Burst Corpse: 
        Target a corpse at a distance to burst it, dealing damage to anybody close to it;

  Curses and sigils:
    + Hex Mark: 
        Hex a single enemy by holding him in crosshar for a short time, applying a medium-timed debuff that lowers it's resistances and kills it if has less than 20% of health while the debuff is active;
        - Hex effect itself is to be implemented yet
    - Hex Trigger:
        Target an enemy marked by your curses (any debuff/DoT that hasn't worn off yet) to detonate him, instantly expiring all debuffs and dealing damage and AOE damage (the longer debuff ticks the more damage this spell deals);
    - Frail Sigil:
        Cast a short-lived AoE sign on the floor that curses any who enter it with a long-timed debuff that slows them down, lowers resistances&damage output;
    - Bonespikes Sigil:
        Target an area on any flat, big enough surface and place a rune that triggers when anybody enters, summoning several violently protruding spikes;
    
Enemies:
  A lot of enemies levitate (to use as little animation as humanly possibe);
  - Slashers - pretty easily killed jump-scare screamers with knives or something that can get in close VERY FAST;
  - Ghouls - close in on you with medium speed and corrupting spikes protrude from their bodies when they are in the medium-melee range;

  - Levitating skull-somethings that try to keep their distance and build up a curse on you (bloodborne 'Winter Lantern'-style) when you're in their line of sight;
  - Flying skulls (medium speed, have to get in close to attack), easy to kill;
  - Ghosts - flying spectral beings that make horrifying sounds, go right through walls and can build up Curse with melee attacks;
  - Flying something - keeps medium distance, shoots fast bone projectiles;
  - Specters - flying dark specters with goat skulls, shoot slow homing projectiles;
