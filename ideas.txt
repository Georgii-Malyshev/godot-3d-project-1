Gameplay mechanics: 
  Mana slowly regenerates, but only up to a certain low threshold that allows to cast 1-2 basic spells max;
  Health slowly regenerates, but only up to a very low threshold (about 15% of max?);
  Saving only at certain points, Kings Field 4-style;
  Player gradually grows more powerful combat-wise by finding new spells as you explore the game world;
  Some spells/items found by exploring/beating certain bosses allow to unlock previously blocked areas;
  No level-ups-by-XP-gained, max health and max mana are increased only by finding certain items, spell damage stays the same;
  Enemies encountered early on are more easily defeated as the player gets more spells and items, but as there are no level-ups, they still remain really dangerous;

  The farther away from savepoints, the more risky exploring gets, but returning back to a savepoint prematurely means leaving new interesting placec that you just got to, Yume Nikki-style;

Various ideas and themes:
  Disturbing nightmare-like scenes that appear randomly after death (but not on the first death!), Yume Nikki-style:
    - Morgue;
    - Sitting at a table with a dead girl, Masodov-style;
    - Endless grey-and-black stairs and floors, Sokurov's 'The Stone' style;
  Most dreadful spells are also used at some locations/storypoints to move further (E.Y.E. Divine Cybermancy-style);

Enemies:
  Most enemies are levitating to use as little animation as humanly possibe;
  Slashers - pretty easily killed jump-scare screamers with knives or something that can get in close VERY FAST;
  Levitating skull-somethings that try to keep their distance and build up a curse on you (bloodborne 'Winter Lantern'-style) when you're in their line of sight;
  Flying skulls (medium speed, have to get in close to attack), easy to kill;
  Ghosts - flying spectral beings that make horrifying sounds, go right through walls and can build up Curse with melee attacks;
